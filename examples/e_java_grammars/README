This directory contains a bunch of Java grammars:

Java1.0.2.jj:
	This is our most thoroughly tested Java grammar.  It is a
	faithful rendering of the language syntax as specified by the
	Java Language Specification by Gosling, Joy, and Steele.

Java.1.0.2LS.jj:
	This is a minor modification of Java1.0.2.jj which uses
	lexical states to express the comment tokens.  While this is a
	cleaner grammar, it has not been tested as thoroughly as the
	previous grammar.  Over time, we will make this grammar our
	primary grammar and delete Java1.0.2.jj.

Java1.1.jj:
	This is the grammar that includes the Java 1.1 language
	extensions.  It is based on the Java Language Specification
	by Gosling, Joy, and Steele augmented by the inner class
	document released with JDK 1.1.

Java1.1noLA.jj:
	Same as Java1.1.jj, but all explicit syntactic lookaheads
	are replaced by semantic lookaheads to minimize the space
	requirements of the generated parser.  To do the same kind
	of optimization for your grammar, please see file OPTIMIZING
	in this directory.

To build a parser from a .jj file, simply type:

  "javacc <grammar-file>"

in this directory.  The files that comprise the Java parser are
generated into this directory.

Compile these files using "javac".

JavaParser.java contains a main program that takes input from either
the standard input or from the file specified as the argument to
"java".  i.e., A Java program can be parser in either of the following
ways:

  java JavaParser < javafile
  java JavaParser javafile
