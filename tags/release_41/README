SUMMARY

JavaCC is an open source compiler compiler.  It takes a grammar
specification as input and produces a stand-alone parser written
in Java.

CONTENTS

This distribution contains the javacc, jjtree and jjdoc sources, 
launcher scripts, example grammars and documentation. It also contains
a bootstrap version of JavaCC needed to build JavaCC.

BUILDING

You need ant-1.5.3 or above to build JavaCC.  You can get ant from:

    http://ant.apache.org

Once you install ant, make sure ant is in your path. Then you can simply
come to this directory (JavaCC source install directory) and type:

    $ ant

it will build the javacc.jar file in the bin/lib directory.

On unix-based systems, you need to make sure the files in the bin
directory of this distribution are in your path.
