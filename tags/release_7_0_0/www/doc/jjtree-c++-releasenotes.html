<h1>JavaCC [tm]: JJTree Release Notes for the C++ version</h1>



<p>
<B>JJTree is extended to support C++ code generation starting with version 6.0. The generated code mostly uses the same design as the Java version. Note that there are still some kinks being worked on - like the NODE_FACTORY option etc.</B>

<i>Please also see javacc-c++-releasenotes.html for some general doc on the C++ version.</i>
