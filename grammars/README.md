# Grammars

In this directory rest a bunch of grammars for different languages, shared under their specific licenses if any, otherwise under the project's global license.

Feel free to enhance them or propose new ones.

These grammars are not part of the project's build process, nor are guaranteed to any extend by the project's support team.
