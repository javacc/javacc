This directory contains the JavaCC grammar for parsing (the proposed)
JDK 1.5 Java language syntax. It handles generics, new for loops, static
imports and annotation types.

BUILDING
--------

Just run

   ant

in this directory and it will build the parser.


RUNNING
-------

You can run the parser directly using

   java JavaParser <fileName>

or there is a new Main class that accepts @<fileName> where the
file with <fileName> contains list of files one per line:

   java Main @<fileName>

REPORTING BUGS
--------------

If you find bugs in the grammar, please file an issue at
javacc.dev.java.net, by logging in and clicking on the 'Issue Tracking'
link on the navigation bar on the left side. You can also send email to:
sreeni@viswanadha.net.
