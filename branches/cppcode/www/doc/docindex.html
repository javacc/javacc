<h1>JavaCC [tm]: Documentation Index</h1>
<p>
By following the links from this page you should be able to obtain all
necessary documentation on JavaCC [tm].
</p>
<p>
If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to
<a href="mailinglist.html">contact us</a>.
We recommend the following step-by-step process to learning JavaCC:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Go through the simple examples that are available as part of the Java Compiler
Compiler [tm] release.  This is located under the <code>examples</code> directory in a
directory called <code>SimpleExamples</code>.  Read the file
<a href="simpleREADME.html"><code>README</code></a>
in this directory for complete instructions.
</li>
<li>
Go through the tree building examples (that use JJTree) that are also available
as part of the JavaCC release.  This is located under the <code>examples</code> directory in a
directory called <code>JJTreeExamples</code>.  Read the file
<a href="jjtreeREADME.html"><code>README</code></a>
in this directory for complete instructions.
</li>
<li>
Study the description of
<a href="javaccgrm.html">the JavaCC grammar file</a>.
This provides the complete syntax of the grammar file along with a detailed
description of these constructs.  There are also many examples in the <a href="http://javacc.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=110">grammar repository</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="commandline.html">Click here</a> to see the document that describes the
command line input syntax.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="apiroutines.html">JavaCC API routines</a> are a bunch of classes,
methods, and variables which may be accessed from user code (typically from
<a href="javaccgrm.html#prod22">actions - the <EM>java_block</EM> in the syntax</a>).
</li>
<li>
<a href="JJTree.html">Click here</a> to get to the JJTree documentation.
</li>
<li>
<a href="JJDoc.html">Click here</a> to get to the JJDoc documentation.
</li>

Detailed JavaCC documentation is organized as a set
of <em>minitutorials</em>, each on a separate topic.  The following
minitutorials are currently available:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="lookahead.html">Lookahead MiniTutorial</a>:
This is a complete guide to how lookahead processing is performed and provides
