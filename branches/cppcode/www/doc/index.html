<h1>Java Compiler Compiler [tm] (JavaCC [tm]) - The Java Parser Generator</h1>


<p>
Java Compiler Compiler [tm] (JavaCC [tm]) is the most popular parser
generator for use with Java [tm] applications.  A parser generator is a
tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java
program that can recognize matches to the grammar.  In addition to
the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities
related to parser generation such as tree building (via a tool
called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions,
debugging, etc.

<p>
We've had hundreds of thousands of downloads and estimate serious
users in the many thousands (and maybe even tens of thousands).  Our
newsgroup <strong>comp.compilers.tools.javacc</strong> and our <a
href="http://java.net/projects/javacc/lists">mailing list</a> together have a few thousand
participants.
</p>

<p>
JavaCC works with any Java VM version 1.2 or greater.  It has been
certified to be 100% Pure Java.  JavaCC has been tested on countless
different platforms without any special porting requirements.  Given
that we have seen JavaCC run on only around 5 or 6 platforms, we think
this is a great testimonial to the "Write Once Run Anywhere" aspect of
the Java programming language.  We say this as engineers who have personally experienced the
benefits of writing Java applications.
