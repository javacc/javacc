<h1>JavaCC [tm]: Installation Notes</h1>


<p>
The download should have placed into your file system either a ZIP
or GZIP file containing the JavaCC software.
</p>

<p>
Depending on which you downloaded, you should go to the directory
where the file was installed and type something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>unzip javacc-5.0.zip</code>
<br />
<br />
<b>or</b>
<br />
<br />
<code>gunzip javacc-5.0.tar.gz</code>
<br />
<code>tar xvf javacc-5.0.tar</code>
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
That completes your installation.
</p>
<p>
Once you have completed installation, add the <code>bin</code> directory
within the JavaCC installation to your path.
The <code>javacc</code>,
<code>jjtree</code>, and <code>jjdoc</code> invocation scripts/executables
reside in this directory.
</p>
<p>
You can get started quickly by looking at the examples and the associated
README files in the <code>examples</code> directory under the installation
directory.  For additional information consult the
<a href="docindex.html">documentation index</a> and the following release notes:
