<h1>Java Compiler Compiler <sup>tm</sup> (JavaCC <sup>tm</sup>) - The Java Parser Generator</h1>

<p><A href="http://java.net/projects/javacc">Main JavaCC home page at its java.net home</A></p>

<p><blink><B>New!!! </B></color></blink>JavaCC can now generate C/C++ code! Please try it out from head of the main source code repository: https://svn.java.net/svn/javacc~svn or svn+ssh://&lt;your java.net userid&gt;@svn.java.net/javacc~svn. Just check out the source code and run ant to build it. We will soon release a beta version.<p>


<p>
Java Compiler Compiler <sup>tm</sup> (JavaCC <sup>tm</sup>) is the most popular parser
generator for use with Java <sup>tm</sup> applications.  A parser generator is a
tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java
program that can recognize matches to the grammar.  In addition to
the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities
related to parser generation such as tree building (via a tool
called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions,
debugging, etc.

We've had hundreds of thousands of downloads and estimate serious
users in the many thousands (and maybe even tens of thousands).  Our
newsgroup <strong>comp.compilers.tools.javacc</strong> and our <a
href="http://java.net/projects/javacc/lists">mailing list</a> together have a few thousand
participants.
</p>

<p>
JavaCC works with any Java VM version 1.2 or greater.  It has been
certified to be 100% Pure Java.  JavaCC has been tested on countless
different platforms without any special porting requirements.  Given
that we have seen JavaCC run on only around 5 or 6 platforms, we think
this is a great testimonial to the "Write Once Run Anywhere" aspect of
the Java programming language.  We say this as engineers who have personally experienced the
benefits of writing Java applications.
