<h1>JavaCC [tm]: Grammar Files</h1>
<p>
This page contains the complete syntax of Java Compiler Compiler [tm]
grammar files with detailed explanations of each construct.
</p>
<p>
Tokens in the grammar files follow the same conventions as for the Java programming language.
Hence identifiers, strings, characters, etc. used in the grammars are
the same as Java identifiers, Java strings, Java characters, etc.
</p>
<p>
<em>White space</em> in the grammar files also follows the same conventions as
for the Java programming language.  This includes the syntax for comments.  Most comments present in
the grammar files are generated into the generated parser/lexical analyzer.
</p>
<p>
Grammar files are preprocessed for Unicode escapes just as Java files
are (i.e., occurrences of strings such as <code>\uxxxx</code> - where <code>xxxx</code> is a hex value -
are converted to the corresponding Unicode character before lexical analysis).
</p>
<p>
<em>Exceptions to the above rules:</em>
The Java operators "<code>&lt;&lt;</code>", "<code>&gt;&gt;</code>", "<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>", "<code>&lt;&lt;=</code>",
"<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>", and "<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;=</code>" are left out of JavaCC's input token list
in order to allow convenient nested use of token specifications.
Finally, the following are the additional reserved words in the Java Compiler
Compiler [tm] grammar files.
</p>

<p>
The grammar file starts with a list of options (which is optional).
This is then followed by a Java compilation unit enclosed between
"PARSER_BEGIN(name)" and "PARSER_END(name)".  After this is a list
of grammar productions.  <a href="#prod2">Options</a> and
<a href="#prod5">productions</a> are described later.
</p>
<p>
The <em>name</em> that follows "PARSER_BEGIN" and "PARSER_END" must
be the same and this identifies the name of the generated parser.
For example, if <em>name</em> is "MyParser", then the following files
are generated:
</p>
<p>
<strong>MyParser.java:</strong>
The generate parser.
<br />
<strong>MyParserTokenManager.java:</strong>
The generated token manager (or scanner/lexical analyzer).
<br />
<strong>MyParserConstants.java:</strong>
A bunch of useful constants.
</p>
<p>
Other files such as "Token.java", "ParseException.java", etc. are also
generated.  However, these files contain boilerplate code and are
the same for any grammar and may be reused across grammars (provided the
grammars use compatible options).
</p>
<p>
Between the PARSER_BEGIN and PARSER_END constructs is a regular
Java compilation unit (a compilation unit in Java lingo is the entire
contents of a Java file).  This may be any arbitrary
Java compilation unit so long as it contains a class declaration
whose name is the same as the name of the generated parser ("MyParser"
in the above example).  Hence, in general, this part of the grammar
file looks like:
</p>
<pre>
    PARSER_BEGIN(parser_name)
    . . .
    class parser_name . . . {
      . . .
    }
    . . .
    PARSER_END(parser_name)
</pre>
<p>
JavaCC does not perform detailed checks on the compilation unit, so
it is possible for a grammar file to pass through JavaCC and generate
Java files that produce errors when they are compiled.
</p>
<p>
If the compilation unit includes a package declaration, this is
included in all the generated files.  If the compilation unit includes
imports declarations, this is included in the generated parser and
token manager files.
</p>
<p>
The generated parser file contains everything in the compilation unit
and, in addition, contains the generated parser code that is included at
the end of the parser class.  For the above example, the generated
parser will look like:
</p>
<pre>
    . . .
    class parser_name . . . {
      . . .
      // generated parser is inserted here.
    }
    . . .
</pre>
<p>
The generated parser includes a public method declaration corresponding
to each non-terminal (see <a href="#prod9">javacode_production</a> and
<a href="#prod11">bnf_production</a>) in the grammar file.  Parsing with
respect to a non-terminal is achieved by calling the method corresponding
to that non-terminal.  Unlike yacc, there is no single start symbol in
JavaCC - one can parse with respect to any non-terminal in the grammar.
</p>
<p>
The generated token manager provides one public method:
</p>
<pre>
    Token getNextToken() throws ParseError;
</pre>
<p>
For more details on how this method may be used, please read
<a href="apiroutines.html">the description of the Java Compiler Compiler
API</a>.

<p>
The options if present, starts with the reserved word "options" followed
by a list of one or more option bindings within braces.  Each option
binding specifies the setting of one option.  The same option may not be
set multiple times.
</p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><a name="LOOKAHEAD">LOOKAHEAD</a>:</strong>
The number of tokens to look ahead before making a
decision at a choice point during parsing.  The default value is 1.
The smaller this number, the faster the parser.  This number may be
overridden for specific productions within the grammar as described
later.  See the description of
<a href="lookahead.html">the lookahead algorithm</a> for complete
details on how lookahead works.
</li>
<li>
<strong>CHOICE_AMBIGUITY_CHECK:</strong>
This is an integer option whose default value is 2.
This is the number of tokens considered in checking choices of the
form "A | B | ..." for ambiguity.  For example, if there is a common
two token prefix for both A and B, but no common three token prefix,
(assume this option is set to 3) then JavaCC can tell you to use a
lookahead of 3 for disambiguation purposes.  And if A and B have a
common three token prefix, then JavaCC only tell you that you need to
have a lookahead of 3 <em>or more</em>.  Increasing this can give you more
comprehensive ambiguity information at the cost of more processing
time.  For large grammars such as the Java grammar, increasing this number
any further causes the checking to take too much time.
</li>
<li>
<strong>OTHER_AMBIGUITY_CHECK:</strong>
This is an integer option whose default value is 1.
This is the number of tokens considered in checking all other kinds of
choices (i.e., of the forms "(A)*", "(A)+", and "(A)?") for ambiguity.
This takes more time to do than the choice checking, and hence the
default value is set to 1 rather than 2.
</li>
<li>
<strong>STATIC:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is true.  If
true, all methods and class variables are specified as static in the
generated parser and token manager.  This allows only one parser object to be present,
but it improves the performance of the parser.  To perform multiple
parses during one run of your Java program, you will have to call the
<a href="apiroutines.html">ReInit()</a>
method to reinitialize your parser if it is static.
If the parser is non-static, you may use the "new" operator to
construct as many parsers as you wish.  These can all be used
simultaneously from different threads.
</li>
<li>
<strong>DEBUG_PARSER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.  This
option is used to obtain debugging information from the generated
parser.  Setting this option to true causes the parser to generate
a trace of its actions.  Tracing may be disabled by
calling the method <a href="apiroutines.html">disable_tracing()</a>
in the generated parser class.  Tracing may be subsequently enabled
by calling the method <a href="apiroutines.html">enable_tracing()</a>
in the generated parser class.
</li>
<li>
<strong>DEBUG_LOOKAHEAD:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.  Setting this
option to true causes the parser to generate all the tracing information
it does when the option DEBUG_PARSER is true, and in addition, also
causes it to generated a trace of actions performed during
<a href="lookahead.html">lookahead operation</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>DEBUG_TOKEN_MANAGER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.  This
option is used to obtain debugging information from the generated
token manager.  Setting this option to true causes the token manager to generate
a trace of its actions.  This trace is rather large and should only
be used when you have a lexical error that has been reported to you
and you cannot understand why.  Typically, in this situation, you
can determine the problem by looking at the last few lines of this trace.
</li>
<li>
<strong>ERROR_REPORTING:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
true.  Setting it to false causes errors due to parse errors to be
reported in somewhat less detail.  The only reason to set this
option to false is to improve performance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
false.  When set to true, the generated parser uses
an input stream object that processes Java Unicode escapes
(\u...) before sending characters to the token manager.  By
default, Java Unicode escapes are not processed.
<br />
This option is ignored if either of options USER_TOKEN_MANAGER,
USER_CHAR_STREAM is set to true.
</li>
<li>
<strong>UNICODE_INPUT:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
false.  When set to true, the generated parser uses
uses an input stream object that reads Unicode files.  By default,
ASCII files are assumed.
<br />
This option is ignored if either of
options USER_TOKEN_MANAGER, USER_CHAR_STREAM is set to true.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a name="IGNORE_CASE">IGNORE_CASE:</a></strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.
Setting this option to true causes the generated token manager to ignore
case in the token specifications and the input files.  This is useful
for writing grammars for languages such as HTML.  It is also possible
to localize the effect of IGNORE_CASE by using
<a href="#prod10">an alternate mechanism described later</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>USER_TOKEN_MANAGER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
false.  The default action is to generate a token manager
that works on the specified grammar tokens.  If this
option is set to true, then the parser is generated to accept tokens
from any token manager of type "TokenManager" - this interface
is generated into the generated parser directory.
</li>
<li>
<strong>SUPPORT_CLASS_VISIBILITY_PUBLIC:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
true.  The default action is to generate support classes (such as
Token.java, ParseException.java etc) with <em>Public</em> visibility. If
set to false, the classes will be generated with package-private
visibility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>USER_CHAR_STREAM:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is
false.  The default action is to generate a character stream reader
as specified by the options JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE and UNICODE_INPUT.
The generated token manager receives characters
from this stream reader.  If this option is set to true, then the
token manager is generated to read characters from any character
stream reader of type "CharStream.java".  This file is generated
into the generated parser directory.
<br />
This option is ignored if USER_TOKEN_MANAGER is set to true.
</li>
<li>
<strong>BUILD_PARSER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is true.
The default action is to generate the parser file ("MyParser.java"
in the above example).  When set to false, the parser file is
not generated.  Typically, this option is set to false when
you wish to generate only the token manager and use it without
the associated parser.
</li>
<li>
<strong>BUILD_TOKEN_MANAGER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is true.
The default action is to generate the token manager file
("MyParserTokenManager.java" in the above example).  When set to
false the token manager file is not generated.  The only reason
to set this option to false is to save some time during parser
generation when you fix problems in the parser part of the grammar
file and leave the lexical specifications untouched.
</li>
<li>
<strong>TOKEN_MANAGER_USES_PARSER:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.
When set to true, the generated token manager will include a field
called <CODE>parser</CODE> that references the instantiating parser
instance (of type <CODE>MyParser</CODE> in the above example).
The main reason for having a parser in a token manager is using
some of its logic in lexical actions.
This option has no effect if the STATIC option is set to true.
</li>
<li>
<strong>TOKEN_EXTENDS:</strong>
This is a string option whose default value is
"", meaning that the generated Token class will extend
java.lang.Object. This option may be set to the name of a
class that will be used as the base class for the generated
<code>Token</code> class.
</li>
<li>
<strong>TOKEN_FACTORY:</strong>
This is a string option whose default value is
"", meaning that Tokens will be created by calling
<code>Token.newToken()</code>. If set the option names a
Token factory class containing a
<code>public static Token newToken(int ofKind, String image)</code>
method.
</li>
<li>
<strong>SANITY_CHECK:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is true.
JavaCC performs many syntactic and semantic checks on the grammar
file during parser generation.  Some checks such as detection of
left recursion, detection of ambiguity, and bad usage of empty
expansions may be suppressed for faster parser generation by
setting this option to false.  Note that the presence of these
errors (even if they are not detected and reported by setting this
option to false) can cause unexpected behavior from the generated
parser.
</li>
<li>
<strong>FORCE_LA_CHECK:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.
This option setting controls lookahead ambiguity checking performed
by JavaCC.  By default (when this option is false), lookahead
ambiguity checking is performed for all choice points where the
default lookahead of 1 is used.  Lookahead ambiguity checking is
not performed at choice points where there is an
<a href="lookahead.html">explicit lookahead specification</a>,
or if the option LOOKAHEAD is set to something other than 1.
Setting this option to true performs lookahead ambiguity checking
at <em>all</em> choice points regardless of the lookahead specifications
in the grammar file.
</li>
<li>
<strong>COMMON_TOKEN_ACTION:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.
When set to true, every call to the token manager's method
"getNextToken" (<a href="apiroutines.html">see the description of the
Java Compiler Compiler API</a>) will cause a call to a used defined
method "CommonTokenAction" after the token has been scanned in by the
token manager.  The user must define this method within the
<a href="#prod12">TOKEN_MGR_DECLS</a> section.
The signature of this method is:
<pre>
    void CommonTokenAction(Token t)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CACHE_TOKENS:</strong>
This is a boolean option whose default value is false.
Setting this option to true causes the generated parser to lookahead for
extra tokens ahead of time.  This facilitates some performance improvements.
However, in this case (when the option is true), interactive
applications may not work since the parser needs to work synchronously
with the availability of tokens from the input stream.  In such cases,
it's best to leave this option at its default value.
</li>
<li>
<strong>OUTPUT_DIRECTORY:</strong>
This is a string valued option whose default value is the current
directory.  This controls where output files are generated.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are four kinds of productions in JavaCC.
<a href="#prod9">javacode_production</a> and <a href="#prod11">bnf_production</a>
are used to define the grammar from which the parser is generated.
<a href="#prod10">regular_expr_production</a> is used to define the grammar
tokens - the token manager is generated from this information (as well as from
inline token specifications in the parser grammar).
<a href="#prod12">token_manager_decls</a> is used to introduce declarations
that get inserted into the generated token manager.
</p>

<p>
The JAVACODE production is a way to write Java code for some
productions instead of the usual EBNF expansion.  This is useful when
there is the need to recognize something that is not context-free
or for whatever reason is very difficult to write a grammar for.
An example of the use of JAVACODE is shown below.  In this example,
the non-terminal "skip_to_matching_brace" consumes tokens in the input
stream all the way up to a matching closing brace (the opening brace
is assumed to have been just scanned):
</p>
<pre>
    JAVACODE
    void skip_to_matching_brace() {
      <a href="apiroutines.html">Token</a> tok;
      int nesting = 1;
      while (true) {
        tok = <a href="apiroutines.html">getToken</a>(1);
        if (tok.kind == LBRACE) nesting++;
        if (tok.kind == RBRACE) {
          nesting--;
          if (nesting == 0) break;
        }
        tok = <a href="apiroutines.html">getNextToken</a>();
      }
    }
</pre>
<p>
Care must be taken when using JAVACODE productions.  While you can
say pretty much what you want with these productions, JavaCC simply
considers it a black box (that somehow performs its parsing task).
This becomes a problem when JAVACODE productions appear at
<a href="lookahead.html">choice points</a>.  For example, if the
above JAVACODE production was referred to from the following production:
</p>
<pre>
  void NT() :
  {}
  {
    skip_to_matching_brace()
  |
    some_other_production()
  }
</pre>
<p>
Then JavaCC would not know how to choose between the two choices.
On the other hand, if the JAVACODE production is used at a non-choice
point as in the following example, there is no problem:
</p>
<pre>
  void NT() :
  {}
  {
    "{" skip_to_matching_brace()
  |
    "(" parameter_list() ")"
  }
</pre>
<p>
JAVACODE productions at choice points may also be preceded by syntactic or
semantic LOOKAHEAD, as in this example:
</p>
<pre>
  void NT() :

<p>
The BNF production is the standard production used
in specifying JavaCC grammars.  Each BNF production has a left hand
side which is a non-terminal specification.  The BNF production then
defines this non-terminal in terms of BNF expansions on the right hand
side.  The non-terminal is written exactly like a declared Java method.
Since each non-terminal is translated into a method
in the generated parser, this style of writing the non-terminal makes
this association obvious.  The name of the non-terminal is the name of
the method, and the parameters and return value declared are the means
to pass values up and down the parse tree.  As will be seen later,
non-terminals on the right hand sides of productions are written as
method calls, so the passing of values up and down the tree are done
using exactly the same paradigm as method call and return.
The default access modifier for BNF productions is public.
</p>
<p>
There are two parts on the right hand side of an BNF production.  The
first part is a set of arbitrary Java declarations and code (the Java
block).  This code is generated at the beginning
of the method generated for the Java non-terminal.  Hence, every time
this non-terminal is used in the parsing process, these declarations and
code are executed.  The declarations in this part are visible to all Java
code in actions in the BNF expansions.  JavaCC does not do any processing
of these declarations and code, except to skip to the matching ending
brace, collecting all text encountered on the way.  Hence, a Java compiler
can detect errors in this code that has been processed by JavaCC.
</p>
<p>
The second part of the right hand side are the BNF expansions.  This
is described <a href="#prod16">later</a>.

A regular expression production is used to define lexical entities
that get processed by the generated token manager.  A detailed description
of how the token manager works is provided in
<a href="tokenmanager.html">this minitutorial (click here)</a>.  This
page describes the syntactic aspects of specifying lexical entities,
while <a href="tokenmanager.html">the minitutorial</a> describes how
these syntactic constructs tie in with how the token manager actually
works.
</p>
<p>
A regular expression production starts with a specification of the
lexical states for which it applies (the
<a href="#newprod1">lexical state list</a>).
There is a standard lexical state called "DEFAULT".  If the
<a href="#newprod1">lexical state list</a> is omitted, the regular
expression production applies to the lexical state "DEFAULT".
</p>
<p>
Following this is a description of what kind of regular expression
production this is (<a href="#prod17">see below for what this means</a>).
</p>
<p>
After this is an optional "[IGNORE_CASE]".  If this is present, the
regular expression production is case insensitive - it has the same
effect as the
<a href="#prod6">IGNORE_CASE</a>
option, except that in this case it applies locally to this regular
expression production.
</p>
<p>
This is then followed by a list of regular expression specifications
that describe in more detail the lexical entities of this regular
expression production.

<p>
The token manager declarations starts with the reserved word
"TOKEN_MGR_DECLS" followed by a ":" and then a set of Java declarations
and statements (the Java block).  These declarations and statements are
written into the generated token manager and are accessible from within
<a href="#prod18">lexical actions</a>.  See
<a href="tokenmanager.html">the minitutorial on the token manager</a>
for more details.
</p>
<p>
There can only be one token manager declaration in a JavaCC grammar file.

This specifies the kind of
<a href="#prod10">regular expression production</a>.
There are four kinds:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a name="TOKEN">TOKEN</a></strong>:
The regular expressions in this regular expression production describe
<em>tokens</em> in the grammar.  The token manager creates a
<a href="apiroutines.html">Token</a> object for each match of such
a regular expression and returns it to the parser.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a name="SPECIAL_TOKEN">SPECIAL_TOKEN</a></strong>:
The regular expressions in this regular expression production describe
<em>special tokens</em>.  Special tokens are like tokens, except that
they do not have significance during parsing - that is the BNF productions
ignore them.  Special tokens are, however, still passed on to the parser
so that parser actions can access them.  Special tokens are passed
to the parser by linking them to neighboring real tokens using the
field "specialToken" in the <a href="apiroutines.html">Token</a>
class.  Special tokens are useful in the processing of lexical entities
such as comments which have no significance to parsing, but still
are an important part of the input file.  See
<a href="tokenmanager.html">the minitutorial on the token manager</a>
for more details of special token handling.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a name="SKIP">SKIP</a></strong>:
Matches to regular expressions in this regular expression production
are simply skipped (ignored) by the token manager.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a name="MORE">MORE</a></strong>:
Sometimes it is useful to gradually build up a token to be passed on
to the parser.  Matches to this kind of regular expression are stored
in a buffer until the next TOKEN or SPECIAL_TOKEN match.  Then all
the matches in the buffer and the final TOKEN/SPECIAL_TOKEN match
are concatenated together to form one TOKEN/SPECIAL_TOKEN that is
passed on to the parser.  If a match to a SKIP regular expression
follows a sequence of MORE matches, the contents of the buffer is
discarded.
</li>
</ul>

The regular expression specification begins the actual description
of the lexical entities that are part of this
<a href="#prod10">regular expression production</a>.
Each regular expression production may contain any number of
regular expression specifications.
</p>
<p>
Each regular expression specification contains a regular expression
followed by a Java block (the lexical action) which is optional.
This is then followed by an identifier of a lexical state (which
is also optional).  Whenever this regular expression is matched,
the lexical action (if any) gets executed, followed by any
<a href="#prod6">common token actions</a>.  Then the action depending
on the
<a href="#prod17">regular expression production kind</a>
is taken.  Finally, if a lexical state is specified, the token
manager moves to that lexical state for further processing (the
token manager starts initially in the state "DEFAULT").

<p>
An expansion unit can be a <a href="#prod21">local LOOKAHEAD specification</a>.
This instructs the
generated parser on how to make choices at choice points.  For details
on how LOOKAHEAD specifications work and how to write LOOKAHEAD specifications,
<a href="lookahead.html">click here to visit the minitutorial on LOOKAHEAD</a>.
</p>
<p>
An expansion unit can be a set of Java declarations and code enclosed
within braces (the Java block).  These are also called <em>parser
actions</em>.  This is generated into the method parsing the
non-terminal at the appropriate location.  This block is executed
whenever the parsing process crosses this point successfully.
When JavaCC processes the Java block, it does not perform any detailed
syntax or semantic checking.  Hence it is possible that the Java compiler
will find errors in your actions that have been processed by JavaCC.
<em>Actions are not executed during
<a href="lookahead.html">lookahead evaluation</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>
An expansion unit can be a parenthesized set of one or more
<a href="#prod16">expansion choices</a>.  In which case, a legal parse of the expansion
unit is any legal parse of the nested expansion choices.
The parenthesized set of expansion choices can be suffixed (optionally) by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>"+":</strong>
Then any legal parse of the expansion unit is one or more
repetitions of a legal parse of the parenthesized set of
expansion choices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>"*":</strong>
Then any legal parse of the expansion unit is zero or more
repetitions of a legal parse of the parenthesized set of
expansion choices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>"?":</strong>
Then a legal parse of the expansion unit is either the
empty token sequence or any legal parse of the nested expansion choices.
An alternate syntax for this construct is to enclose the
expansion choices within brackets "[...]".
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An expansion unit can be a <a href="#prod19">regular expression</a>.  Then a legal parse
of the expansion unit is any token that matches this regular
expression.  When a regular expression is matched, it creates an
object of type <a href="apiroutines.html">Token</a>.  This object
can be accessed by assigning it to a variable by prefixing the
regular expression with "variable =".  In general, you may have any
valid Java assignment left-hand side to the left of the "=".
<em>This assignment is not performed during
<a href="lookahead.html">lookahead evaluation</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>
An expansion unit can be a non-terminal (the last choice in the syntax
above).  In which case, it takes
the form of a method call with the non-terminal name used as the
name of the method.  A successful parse of the non-terminal causes
the parameters placed in the method call to be operated on and a
value returned (in case the non-terminal was not declared to be
of type "void").  The return value can be assigned (optionally) to
a variable by prefixing the regular expression with "variable =".
In general, you may have any
valid Java assignment left-hand side to the left of the "=".
<em>This assignment is not performed during
<a href="lookahead.html">lookahead evaluation</a>.</em>
Non-terminals may not be used in an expansion in a manner that introduces
left-recursion.  JavaCC checks this for you.

<p>
A local lookahead specification is used to influence the way the generated
parser makes choices at the various
<a href="lookahead.html">choice points</a>
in the grammar.  A local lookahead specification starts with the reserved
word "LOOKAHEAD" followed by a set of lookahead constraints within parentheses.
There are three different kinds of lookahead constraints - a lookahead limit
(the integer literal), a syntactic lookahead (the expansion choices), and
a semantic lookahead (the expression within braces).  At least one lookahead
constraint must be present.  If more than one lookahead constraint is present,
they must be separated by commas.
</p>
<p>
For a detailed description of how lookahead works, please
<a href="lookahead.html">click here to visit the minitutorial on LOOKAHEAD</a>.
A brief description of each kind of lookahead constraint is given below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lookahead Limit:</strong>
This is the maximum number of tokens of lookahead that may be used for choice
determination purposes.  This overrides the default value which is specified
by the <a href="#prod2">LOOKAHEAD option</a>.  This lookahead limit applies
only to the <a href="lookahead.html">choice point</a>
at the location of the local lookahead specification.
If the local lookahead specification is not at a choice point, the lookahead
limit (if any) is ignored.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntactic Lookahead:</strong>
This is an expansion (or expansion choices) that is used for the purpose of
determining whether or not the particular choice that this local lookahead
specification applies to is to be taken.  If this was not provided, the parser
uses the expansion to be selected during lookahead determination.
If the local lookahead specification is not at a
<a href="lookahead.html">choice point</a>, the syntactic
lookahead (if any) is ignored.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Semantic Lookahead:</strong>
This is a boolean expression that is evaluated whenever the parser crosses this
point during parsing.  If the expression evaluates to true, the parsing
continues normally.  If the expression evaluates to false and the local
lookahead specification is at a <a href="lookahead.html">choice point</a>,
the current choice is not taken and the next choice is considered.
If the expression evaluates to false and the local lookahead specification
is <em>not</em> at a choice point, then parsing aborts with a parse error.
Unlike the other two lookahead constraints that are ignored at non-choice
points, semantic lookahead is always evaluated.  In fact, semantic lookahead
is even evaluated if it is encountered during the evaluation of some other
syntactic lookahead check (for more details
<a href="lookahead.html">click here to visit the minitutorial on LOOKAHEAD</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Default values for lookahead constraints:</strong>
If a local lookahead specification has been provided, but not all lookahead
constraints have been included, then the missing ones are assigned default
values as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the lookahead limit is not provided and if the syntactic lookahead is
provided, then the lookahead limit defaults to the largest integer value
(2147483647).  This essentially implements "infinite lookahead" - namely,
look ahead as many tokens as necessary to match the syntactic lookahead that
has been provided.
</li>
<li>
If neither the lookahead limit nor the syntactic lookahead has been
provided (which means the semantic lookahead is provided), the lookahead
limit defaults to 0.  This means that syntactic lookahead is not performed
(it passes trivially), and only semantic lookahead is performed.
</li>
<li>
If the syntactic lookahead is not provided, it defaults to the choice
to which the local lookahead specification applies.  If the local lookahead
specification is not at a choice point, then the syntactic lookahead is
ignored - hence a default value is not relevant.
</li>
<li>
If the semantic lookahead is not provided, it defaults to the boolean
expression "true".  That is, it trivially passes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are two places in a grammar files where regular expressions may be
written:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Within a <a href="#prod18">regular expression specification</a>
(part of a <a href="#prod10">regular expression production</a>),
</li>
<li>
As an <a href="#prod22">expansion unit</a> with an <a href="#prod20">expansion</a>.
When a regular expression is used in this manner, it is as if the regular expression
were defined in the following manner at this location and then referred to by its
label from the expansion unit:
<pre>
    &lt;DEFAULT&gt; TOKEN :
    {
      regular expression
    }
</pre>
That is, this usage of regular expression can be rewritten using the other
kind of usage.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The complete details of regular expression matching by the token manager is
available in
<a href="tokenmanager.html">the minitutorial on the token manager</a>.  The
description of the syntactic constructs follows.
</p>
<p>
The first kind of regular expression is a string literal.  The input being
parsed matches this regular expression if the token manager is in a
<a href="#prod10">lexical state</a> for which this regular expression applies
and the next set of characters in the input stream is the same (possibly with
case ignored) as this string literal.
</p>
<p>
A regular expression may also be a more <a href="#prod29">complex regular expression</a>
using which more involved regular expression (than string literals can be defined).
Such a regular expression is placed within angular brackets "&lt;...&gt;", and
may be labeled optionally with an identifier.  This label may be used to refer
to this regular expression from
<a href="#prod22">expansion units</a>
or from within other regular expressions.
If the label is preceded by a "#", then this regular expression may not be
referred to from expansion units, but only from within other regular expressions.
When the "#" is present, the regular expression is referred to as a
"private regular expression".
</p>
<p>
A regular expression may be a reference to some other labeled regular expression
in which case it is written as the label enclosed in angular brackets "&lt;...&gt;".
</p>
<p>
Finally, a regular expression may be a reference to the predefined regular
expression "&lt;EOF&gt;" which is matched by the end of file.
</p>
<p>
Private regular expressions are not matched as tokens by the token manager.
Their purpose is solely to facilitate the definition of other more complex
regular expressions.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following example defining Java floating point literals:
</p>
<pre>
TOKEN :
{
  &lt; FLOATING_POINT_LITERAL:
        (["0"-"9"])+ "." (["0"-"9"])* (&lt;EXPONENT>)? (["f","F","d","D"])?
      | "." (["0"-"9"])+ (&lt;EXPONENT>)? (["f","F","d","D"])?
      | (["0"-"9"])+ &lt;EXPONENT> (["f","F","d","D"])?
      | (["0"-"9"])+ (&lt;EXPONENT>)? ["f","F","d","D"]
  >
|
  &lt; #EXPONENT: ["e","E"] (["+","-"])? (["0"-"9"])+ &gt;
}
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the token FLOATING_POINT_LITERAL is defined using the
definition of another token, namely, EXPONENT.  The "#" before the label
EXPONENT indicates that this exists solely for the purpose of defining other
tokens (FLOATING_POINT_LITERAL in this case).  The definition of
FLOATING_POINT_LITERAL is not affected by the presence or absence of the "#".
However, the token manager's behavior is.  If the "#" is omitted, the
token manager will
erroneously recognize a string like E123 as a legal token of kind EXPONENT
(instead of IDENTIFIER in the Java grammar).

<p>
A complex regular expression unit can be a string literal,  in which case
there is exactly one match for this unit, namely, the string literal itself.
</p>
<p>
A complex regular expression unit can be a reference to another regular
expression.  The other regular expression has to be labeled so that it
can be referenced.  The matches of this unit are all the matches of this
other regular expression.  Such references in regular expressions cannot
introduce loops in the dependency between tokens.
</p>
<p>
A complex regular expression unit can be a <a href="#prod32">character list</a>.
A character list is a way of defining a set of characters.  A match for this
kind of complex regular expression unit is any character that is allowed
by the character list.
</p>
<p>
A complex regular expression unit can be a parenthesized set of
complex regular expression choices.  In this case, a legal match of
the unit is any legal match of the nested choices.  The parenthesized
set of choices can be suffixed (optionally) by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>"+":</strong>
Then any legal match of the unit is one or more
repetitions of a legal match of the parenthesized set of

Then a legal match of the unit is either the
empty string or any legal match of the nested choices.

<p>
Note that unlike the BNF <a href="#prod20">expansions</a>,
the regular expression "[...]" is not equivalent
to the regular expression "(...)?".  This is because the [...]
construct is used to describe <a href="#prod32">character lists</a>
in regular expressions.

A character list describes a set of characters.  A legal match for a
character list is any character in this set.  A character list is a list
of character descriptors separated by commas within square brackets.
Each character descriptor describes a single character or a range of characters
(see <a href="#prod33">character descriptor</a> below),
and this is added to the set of characters of the character
list.  If the character list is prefixed by the "~" symbol, the set of
characters it represents is any UNICODE character not in the specified set.

<p>
A character descriptor can be a single character string literal, in which
case it describes a singleton set containing that character; or it is
two single character string literals separated by a "-", in which case, it
describes the set of all characters in the range between and including these
two characters.
