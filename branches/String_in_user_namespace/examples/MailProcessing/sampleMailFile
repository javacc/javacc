In the last couple of days, we had seen a couple of users facing problems with
regular expressions that match "". There is a minor bug in the way it is 
implemented in 0.6.-9. We will fix it.

But the purpose of this mail is to suggest you should be careful when you use
RE's that match the "" string. Consider the following example of string literals
where two consecutive "" are interpreted as the literal " (equivalent to \" in
Java).

< STRING_LITERAL: ( "\"" (~["\""])* "\"" )* >

This will work in general. But, if this a part of a lot of other lexical rules,
then if there a lexical error, say a char is given that cannot be the first one
of any token, then, the lexer decides to use the empty string "" and match it
as STRING_LITERAL without actually giving the lexical error. And since this is
the empty string, no character will be consumed and you will start getting the
same STRING_LITERAL token (with "" as the image) infinte number of times. In
fact, if this was the only lexical rule, then if you give a input that starts
with any char other than the ", you will get into an infinite loop.

So a better alternative is to use the + operator which will not match the empty
string. As a matter of fact, I don't know any practical grammar where matching
"" is useful.

In version 0.5, the lexer generated implicitly treated it as + (which is not
totally right). But in 0.6.-9, it does it right and so there is a chance that
your grammar that used to work with 0.5 will not work with 0.6.-9. So if you
have any top-level lexical rule with ? or *, please change those rules so that
they don't match the empty string "".

Sreeni.

I previously sent a message entitled "A first cut at an HTML grammar".
Did people not get it?  If not, see:
http://www.tiac.net/users/kimbo/jack/HTML.jack

> Is there a way to construct a *.jack file out of a *.sgml file?

Sorry, I can't help with this.

Well, I finally got an HTML grammar out there (at
http://www.tiac.net/users/kimbo/jack/HTML.jack).  I hope you saw it, I
got some mailer errors, that seemed like the kind that you could ignore,
but at least one person didn't receive my first posting.

I'd be interested to know if this is the sort of thing people are
looking for, or do they want the full set of tags enumerated in the
grammar as well?  Also, if there you have any desire to bundle this with
Jack (possibly after upgrades and/or integration with other people's
work), please feel free.

I must say Jack is an amazing tool.  It was really easy to learn.  I
love how readable the grammars are, and I love being able to pass info
up and down the productions as the parser runs.  I never want to have to
settle for LALR(1) again!  Thanks for writing it!
