BUILDING JAVAC
==============

You need ant-1.4.1 or above to build JavaCC. You can get ant from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

Once you install ant, make sure ant is in your path. Then you can simply
come to this directory (JavaCC source install directory) and type:

ant

it will build the javacc.jar file in the bin/lib directory.
