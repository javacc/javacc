<H1>JavaCC [tm]: JJDoc Documentation</H1>

JJDoc takes a JavaCC [tm] parser specification and produces documentation
for the BNF grammar.  It can operate in three modes, determined by
command line options.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>TEXT</code></dt>

      <dd>(default false)

	<p>Setting <code>TEXT</code> to true causes JJDoc to generate
	a plain text format description of the BNF.  Some formatting
	is done via tab characters, but the intention is to leave it
	as plain as possible.</p>

	<p>The default value of <code>TEXT</code> causes JJDoc to
	  generate a hyperlinked HTML document.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>ONE_TABLE</code></dt>

      <dd>(default true)

	<p>The default value of <code>ONE_TABLE</code> is used to
	  generate a single HTML table for the BNF.  Setting it to
	  false will produce one table for every production in the
	  grammar.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>OUTPUT_FILE</code></dt>

      <dd>The default behavior is to put the JJDoc output into a file
	with either .html or .txt added as a suffix to the input
	file's base name.  You can supply a different file name with
	this option.
      </dd>

      <dt><code>CSS</code></dt>

      <dd>This option allows you to specify a CSS file name.  If you supply
      a file name in this option it will appear in a <code>LINK</code> element
      in the <code>HEAD</code> section of the file.  This option only applies
      to HTML output.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When in <code>TEXT</code> mode, or when <code>ONE_TABLE</code>
    is false, comments in the JavaCC source that immediately precede a
    production are passed through to the generated documentation.</p>
